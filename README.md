# TaskStack
Work on yourself in Agile!

First off, I acknowledge the triteness of saying agile all the time but just go with it for now.
This is something I've had in my mind for a while and finally decided to do. Basically the premise of this app is to combine 
a to-do list, "agile" task handling, and my personal method of beating procrastination.

My hope is that all of these combined should allow users to have a pretty good grasp of how productive they're being and what they can be working on if they're not.

Plenty of features I plan on adding including (in no particular order):

Task List:
  1. swiping feature to go between various groups of tasks
  2. menu button or some sort of thing to allow you to filter tasks how you'd like
  3. colors
  4. pictures
  5. ability to manually edit tasks by clicking them on the list
  6. ability to mark them as done and stuff too

Menu:
  1. pictures to replace the buttons
  2. a bar on the bottom that can be used to navigate anywhere at any time
  3. maybe a different arrangement
  4. a dashboard like thing that shows you what tasks are in progress
  
features:
  1. a screen that shows tasks you're working on and have finished maybe
  2. more
  
Tasks:
  1. duration, priority, deadline as additional fields on creation

Task assignment:
  1. make it
  2. allow users to filter what tasks they want to get 
  
Next up: filter tasks in the list screen
